This repository contains a reference sheet `hypothesis-tests-reference.pdf`, which lists formulas you need to know for some classical hypothesis tests, and `intro-to-hypothesis-testing.pdf`, some lecture notes that I use when introducing students to testing for the first time. 

The reference sheet is a work in progress, but has this flavor:

and exists because it's nice to have these all in one place and I have to teach these tests all the time.

Pull requests to add new tests or improve notation and formating are very welcome! Both pdf documents are compiled from the corresponding `*.Rmd` files.

### Caveat

Blasting students with this information is my least favorite way to teach hypothesis testing. If I had my way I would teach only the nonparametric bootstrap, or barring that, I'd follow Jonas Lindel√∏v's [tests as linear models approach](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/).
